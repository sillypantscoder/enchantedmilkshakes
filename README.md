The best Minecraft mod ever.

## Contents

List of things in the mod:

### Fries

Fries is a food item. You can get it by putting a baked potato in a stonecutter. When you eat it, you get crumbs.

### Crumbs

You're such a messy eater. You get crumbs whenever you eat another food item. Nine crumbs can be crafted into a sliced bread.

### Sausage

Sausages are a food item that can be crafted into hot dogs. Sausages are currently uncraftable.

### Sliced Bread

Sliced Bread is half as good as bread. You can get it by putting bread in a stonecutter, and you can use it to craft many things in this mod.

### Hamburger

You can craft a hamburger from 1 steak and 2 sliced bread. It's just a normal hamburger. Yum.

### Hot dog

Hot dogs are delicious items crafted from 1 sausage and 2 sliced bread.

### bottlexp

/bottlexp is a command that turns your experience into bottles of enchanting! Yay

### Milkshake

A milkshake is an item used primarily to create enchanted milkshakes. You can craft it with one sugar, one milk and a cow soul!

### Enchanted Milkshake

Enchanted milkshakes are ranged items that, when thrown, deal 1,300 damage to whatever you hit. They're really powerful, but surprisingly hard to aim.

### Cow Soul

A cow soul is a very rare drop from cows. It is used to craft enchanted milkshakes.

### Fast Food

Fast Food is an advancement that activates once you are able to convince your parents to get you fast food.

### Sandwich

A Sandwich is crafted from one carrot and two sliced bread, and is literally a witch made of sand.

### Chocolate Bar

A Chocolate Bar is crafted from siz cocoa beans. It either gives you a lot of bad effects, or a lot of good effects. And there is a 1% chance that you fly into the air.

### Ice cream

Ice cream is crafted from blue ice, sugar, and milk. It's used to craft ice cream sandwiches.

### Ice cream sandwich

Ice cream sandwiches are crafted from 2 sliced bread, a chocolate bar, and an ice cream.

### Bob

Bob is a boss mob that attacks you with enchanted milkshakes! He looks like a villager but is black and white. He attacks players, and only spawn naturally in the outer End islands. (A Bob Spawn Egg is available.)

### Kahoot Disc

A new music disc: The Kahoot Lobby Music!

### ULTIMATE SANDWICH

The ULTIMATE SANDWICH is an amazing item. Eating it gives you Absorption, Regeneration, Fire Resistance, and Resistance, plus it has a 10% chance to duplicate each item in your inventory. But it's hard to craft: You need 5 ice cream sandwiches, plus two normal sandwiches, to craft it. Combining one with a chorus fruit in the crafting table gives you an elytra!
